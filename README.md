this is a simple app which will randomly remind you of things throughout the day.
you put in a text file, specify a time range and an integer n, the app will then give you a notification of the text of a random line of the text file, n times a day, at random times within the daily interval. 

TODO:
	allow for file selection rather than type in path
	implement notification settings
	display on the UI whether or not the thing is active
	add ability to change notification settings (vibrate, sound, led)
