this is a simple app which will randomly remind you of things throughout the day.
you put in a text file, specify a time range and an integer n, the app will then give you a notification of the text of a random line of the text file, n times a day, at random times within the daily interval. 

TODO:
	allow for file selection rather than type in path
	make it repeat everyday
	implement notification settings
	implement saved settings
	display on the UI whether or not the thing is active
